For game research in MSRA IG group, we created a great D3D engine on DirectX 9.0c as our own research platform.The whole work about Supra takes three members (one full-time employee, one full-time student, one part-time employee) four weeks.

Not until the platform had been finished, we all too impatient to wait for transferring and creating our research projects on it, like 3D Snow Creator for MGS, GPU Gradient HDR Compression, etc.  
  
At MSRA, We all focus on pure algorithms research for rendering, modeling... other than some basic technology in 3D game. So, many things like Graphic Engine, Debug or Log system, Command console etc. should be integrated in an universal platform.  
  
We created the system and named it "Supra".  
Still, I can not supply the Demos for SLC or its details because they are MS confidential.

Great Supra Engine!  
I'll improve it in the future and  almost all of my research work will profit from  "Supra".
