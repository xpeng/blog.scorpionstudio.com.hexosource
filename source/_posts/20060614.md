We present a system for compressing high dynamic range images to fit conventional display devices that are only capable of outputting a low dynamic range. In addition to manipulating the gradient field of luminance image by attenuating the large gradients‘ magnitudes, it can preserve fine details, resulting in an image which provokes the same responses as someone would have viewing the scene in the real world. Specifically, with the whole process built on programmable graphics hardware, we present an efficient algorithm based on GPU acceleration and provide a fast dynamic range compression technique. Furthermore, we describe a framework for rendering high dynamic range images in real time. It not only can be used in image based tone mapping but also is able to be a core technique in interactive graphics applications.

OK, After Image Processing, High Dynamic Range Compression, Poisson Equation, Programmable Graphics Hardware...I've implemented a demo for GPUGHDRC, which is based on Supra Engine.  For MS Confidential, I can not supply the demo.  

All the algorithms and details of implementation are described in my paper “[High Dynamic Range Compression on Programmable Graphics Hardware](http://www.xf-utpcb.com/xiaop/MyProjects/GPUGHDRC/GPUGHDRC.pdf)”（Appeared in Microcomputer Development, Issue 9, 2005）.
