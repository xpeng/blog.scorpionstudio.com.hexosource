Recently i plan to create an indie game for some people like me. I find the tool TexturePacker is very useful to me in creating sprite packages, i think i should use some advanced functions so i hope the author can send me a free license key, this will help me to finish this game in short time.

To prove that I am the blog's owner, i should place a code here:
