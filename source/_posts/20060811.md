　　出于对CH中可预测随机世界的追求，我最近看了看相关噪声的一些文献，并找到一个开源库libnoise，link：[http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html)

libnoise is a portable C++ library that is used to generate coherent noise, a type of smoothly-changing noise. libnoise can generate Perlin noise, ridged multifractal noise, and other types of coherent-noise.  
  
Coherent noise is often used by graphics programmers to generate natural-looking textures, planetary terrain, and other things.  
  
In libnoise, coherent-noise generators are encapsulated in classes called noise modules. There are many different types of noise modules. Some noise modules can combine or modify the outputs of other noise modules in various ways; you can join these modules together to generate very complex coherent noise.  

　　我可能考虑在CH中采用这种技术生成可预测的随机地形或者星球表面、星系背景等等
