After [implementing an  CH investigation system in 2001](http://blog.scorpionstudio.com:8090/projects/ch2001/ch2001.htm) and making an investigation on MS Mythica and HalfLife 2 system, I've started the process of CH project at Jul. 2004.  
  
Currently, it's in the Preproduction Stage! At the end of it, I'll deliver a prototype of CH.
