After [implementing an  CH investigation system in 2001](http://xiaop.cnblogs.com/admin/ch2002.htm) and making an investigation on MS Mythica and HalfLife 2 system, I've started the process of CH project at Jul. 2004.  
  
Currently, it's in the Preproduction Stage! At the end of it, I'll deliver a prototype of CH.
